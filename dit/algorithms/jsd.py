    Parameters
    ----------
    dists: [Distribution]
        The distributions, P_i, to take the Jensen-Shannon Divergence of.

    weights: [float], None
        The weights, w_i, to give the distributions. If None, the weights are assumed to be uniform.

    ditException

        Raised if the weights do not sum to unity.
