def joint_from_factors(mdist, cdists, strict=True):
    """
    Returns a joint distribution P(X,Y) built from P(X) and P(Y|X).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mdist : Distribution
        The marginal distribution P(X).
    cdists : list
        The list of conditional distributions P(Y|X=x).
    strict : bool
        If ``True``, then the ordering of the random variables is inferred
        from the masks on each distribution. If the masks are not compatible,
        meaning that one is not the elementwise complement of the other, then
        an exception is raised. If ``False``, then the distributions are
        combined such that all of X appears before all of Y. Effectively, the
        existing masks are ignored in that situation.

    Returns
    -------
    d : Distribution
        The joint distribution P(X,Y).

    Raises
    ------
    ditException
        When ``strict=True`` and the masks for ``mdist`` and ``cdists`` are
        not compatible with each other.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> d = dit.random_distribution(5, 2)
    >>> d.set_rv_names('ABCDE')
    >>> pBD, pACEgBD = d.condition_on('BD')
    >>> pABCDE = dit.joint_from_factors(pBD, pACEgBD)
    >>> pABCDE.is_approx_equal(d)
