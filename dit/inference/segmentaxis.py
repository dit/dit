def segment_axis(a, length, overlap=0, axis=None, end='cut', endvalue=0):
    """Generate a new array that chops the given array along the given axis
    into overlapping frames.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like
        The array to segment
    length : int
        The length of each frame
    overlap : int, optional
        The number of array elements by which the frames should overlap
    axis : int, optional
        The axis to operate on; if None, act on the flattened array
    end : {'cut', 'wrap', 'pad'}, optional
        What to do with the last frame, if the array is not evenly
        divisible into pieces.

            - 'cut'   Simply discard the extra values
            - 'wrap'  Copy values from the beginning of the array
            - 'pad'   Pad with a constant value

    endvalue : object
        The value to use for end='pad'


    Examples
    --------
    >>> segment_axis(arange(10), 4, 2)
    array([[0, 1, 2, 3],
           [2, 3, 4, 5],
           [4, 5, 6, 7],
           [6, 7, 8, 9]])

    Notes
    -----
    The array is not copied unless necessary (either because it is
    unevenly strided and being flattened or because end is set to
    'pad' or 'wrap').
