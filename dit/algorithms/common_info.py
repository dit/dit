    Returns the Gacs-Korner common information H[X] over the random

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : Distribution
        The distribution from which the common information is calculated. 
    rvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variable used to calculate the entropy.
        If None, then the entropy is calculated over all random variables.
    rv_names : bool
        If `True`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random variable
        names. If `False`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random
        variable indexes.  If `None`, then the value `True` is used if the
        distribution has specified names for its random variables.

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        The Gacs-Korner common information of the distribution.
