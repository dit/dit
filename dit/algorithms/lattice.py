Some algorithms related to lattices.

Here we are concerned with determining random variable induced sigma-algebras.
That is, we want to know the subsigma-algebra (of the underlying sigma-algebra)
that corresponds to a random variable. However, we consider only those random
variables that map outcomes in the underlying sigma-algebra to a projection of
that outcome. For example, if an outcome in the underlying sigma-algebra is
(1,2,3), then random variable `X_1` would take on the value (2,) and the joint
random variable `X_0,X_2` has the value (1,2). By considering all possible
induced sigma-algebras, we are equivalently considering all possible partitions
of the sample space.

Relationship to Intersection Information based on Common Randomness
--------------------------------------------------------------------
In general, the meet and join operators are defined with respect to information
equivalence, which in turn, derives from the notions of informationally
richer/poorer. In this module, richer and poorer correspond to refinements and
coarsenings of the sample space and thus, depend explicitly on the structure
of the underlying sigma-algebra.

As an example, consider the r.v.s. X and Y, where X = 1 and Y = X with p=1 and
Y = 0 with p=0. There is a sense in X and Y have the same distribution. However,
X and Y are not informationally equivalent as there is a function f such that
X = f(Y) where f maps 0 and 1 to 1, but not the other way around. One imagines
X as the coarsest possible partition of the sample space, whereas Y is a
refinement. To wit, the sample space is {10,11} with p(10) = 0 and p(11) = 1.
Then X corresponds to the partition: {(10, 11)} while Y is {(10,), (11,)}.

In [1], richer and poorer are defined in terms of probability almost surely.
That is, X is informationally poorer than Y if X = f(Y) almost surely.  This
means that the definition is not as sensitive to the structure of the
underlying sigma-algebra. In the above example, X and Y are now informationally
equivalent, even though Y is a refinement of the partition corresponding to X.

In general, there is a trend that coarser partitions correspond to
informationally poorer random variables (but due to the partial ordering, not
all partitions are comparable to one another).  In [1], a (comparable) coarser
partition is only poorer if the coarsening involves outcomes with nonzero
probability. Said another way, a r.v. that corresponds to a refinement of
another r.v. is informationally richer only if it refines outcomes which have
nonzero probability.

If the behavior of [1] is desired, one must make sure to prune the sample space
of any outcomes that have zero probability. Then, the implementation here will
give the same results as [1].
