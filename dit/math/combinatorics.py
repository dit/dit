def unitsum_tuples(n, k, mn, mx):
    """Generates unitsum k-tuples with elements from mn to mx.

    This function is more general than slots(n,k,normalized=True), as it can
    return unitsum vectors with elements outside of (0,1).

    In order to generate unitsum samples, the following must be satisfied:
        1 = mx + (k-1) * mn

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of increments to include between mn and mx. n >= 1. The
        meaning of n is similar to the n in slots(n,k) and represents the
        number of ``items'' to place in each slot.
    k : int
        The length of the tuples (equivalently, the number of slots).
    mn : float
        The minimum value in the unitsum samples.
    mx : float
        The maximum value in the unitsum samples.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> s = unitsum_tuples(3, 2, .2, .8)
    >>> s.next()
    (0.20000000000000001, 0.80000000000000004)
    >>> s.next()
    (0.40000000000000008, 0.60000000000000009)
    >>> s.next()
    (0.60000000000000009, 0.40000000000000002)
    >>> s.next()

def slots(n, k, normalized=False):
    """Generates distributions of n identical items into k distinct slots.

    A generator over distributions of n indistinguishable items into k
    distinguishable slots, where each slot can hold up to n items.
    Selection of items is done without replacement, and the order within the
    slots cannot matter since the items are indistinguishable.

    The number of distributions is (n + k - 1)! / n! / (k-1)!

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of indistinguishable items.
    k : int
        The number of distinguishable slots.
    normalized : bool
        If True, then we divide each term in the tuple by the number of items.
        The default value is False.

    Yields
    ------
    t : tuple
        A tuple of length k where each element is an integer representing
        the number of indistinguishable items within the slot.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> list(slots(3,2))
    [(0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 0)]
