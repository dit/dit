def extropy(dist, rvs=None, rv_names=None):
    """
    Returns the extropy J[X] over the random variables in `rvs`.

    If the distribution represents linear probabilities, then the extropy
    is calculated with units of 'bits' (base-2).

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : Distribution or float
        The distribution from which the extropy is calculated. If a float,
        then we calculate the binary extropy.
    rvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variable used to calculate the extropy.
        If None, then the extropy is calculated over all random variables.
        This should remain `None` for ScalarDistributions.
    rv_names : bool
        If `True`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random variable
        names. If `False`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random
        variable indexes.  If `None`, then the value `True` is used if the
        distribution has specified names for its random variables.

    Returns
    -------
    J : float
        The extropy of the distribution.
