    Construct minimal alphabets for each random variable.

    ----------
    outcomes : sequence
        A nonempty sequence of outcomes.  Each outcome in `outcomes` should
        be a sequence---these are the elements which determine the alphabet

    Examples
    --------
    >>> construct_alphabets([(0,1), (1,1)])

    ------
