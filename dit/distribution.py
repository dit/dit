"""
Module defining base distribution class.

The set of all possible outcomes is known as the sample space. An element of
the sample space is known as an outcome or sample. Ambiguously, "sample" is
also used to refer to a sequence of outcomes. For example, we often speak
about the "sample size".  In general, `dit` will tend to use the term "outcome"
over "sample".  The main exception will be that we still refer to the "sample
space", instead of the "outcome space", as this is mostly a universal standard.

Recall that an event is a subset of outcomes from the sample space. In `dit`
distributions are specified by assigning probabilities to each outcome
of the sample space.  This corresponds to assigning probabilities to each of
the atoms in the underlying sigma-algebra that defines the probability space.
Queries to the distribution using the [] operator return the probability of an
outcome---it is not necessary to pass the outcome in as a singleton event.
Event probabilities are obtained through the `event_probability` method.
There is a corresponding `outcome_probability` method as well (which just uses
the [] operator).

`None` is not an allowable outcome.  `dit` uses `None` to signify that an
outcome does not exist in the sample space.  We do not enforce this rule.
Rather, things will probably just break.

The most basic type of outcome must be: hashable and equality comparable.
If the distribution's sample space is to be ordered, then the outcomes must
also be orderable (which implies equality comparable).

Joint outcomes must be: hashable, orderable, and also a sequence.
Recall, a sequence is a sized, iterable container. See:
http://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections-abstract-base-classes

TODO: Examine thread-safety issues.  Most of the methods will not function
properly if interrupted midway through (and the distribution is modified).

        Parameters
        ----------
        digits : int or None
            The probabilities will be rounded to the specified number of
            digits, using NumPy's around function. If `None`, then no rounding
            is performed. Note, if the number of digits is greater than the

            match that smaller precision.
        exact : bool
            If `True`, then linear probabilities will be displayed, even if
            the underlying pmf contains log probabilities.  The closest
            rational fraction within a tolerance specified by `tol` is used
