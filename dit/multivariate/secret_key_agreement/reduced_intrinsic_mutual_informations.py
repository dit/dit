    Given a measure of shared information, construct an optimizer which computes
    its ``reduced intrinsic'' form.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : function
        A function which computes the information shared by a set of variables.
        It must accept the arguments `rvs' and `crvs'.

    Returns
    -------
    RIMI : BaseReducedIntrinsicMutualInformation
        An reduced intrinsic mutual information optimizer using `func` as the
        measure of multivariate mutual information.

    Notes
    -----
    Due to the casting to a Distribution for processing, optimizers constructed
    using this function will be significantly slower than if the objective were
    written directly using the joint probability ndarray.
