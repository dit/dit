    Returns `True` if every outcome is in the sample space.

    Implicitly, this also verifies that every outcome is of the same class

    If the sample space supports the __in__ operator, then this will be
    linear in the number of outcomes. If not, then this will have to do an
    O(number of items in the sample space) for each outcome. This can be
    problematic if the sample space is large.

    Parameters
    ----------
    outcomes : list
        The outcomes that will be checked against the sample space.
    sample_space : iterable
        The sample space.
