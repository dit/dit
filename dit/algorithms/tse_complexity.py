    Calculates the TSE complexity.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : Distribution
        The distribution from which the TSE complexity is calculated.
    rvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variable used to calculate the TSE complexity
        between. If None, then the TSE complexity is calculated over all random
        variables.
    crvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variables to condition on. If None, then no
        variables are condition on.
    rv_names : bool
        If `True`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random variable
        names. If `False`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random
        variable indexes.  If `None`, then the value `True` is used if the
        distribution has specified names for its random variables.

    Returns
    -------
    TSE : float
        The TSE complexity.

    Raises
    ------
    ditException
        Raised if `dist` is not a joint distribution.
