    Parameters
    ----------
    pmf : NumPy array, shape (n,)
        An array of floats representing the probability mass function. The
        events will be the indices of the list. The floats should represent
        probabilities (and not log probabilities).
    rand : float
        The sample is drawn using the passed number.

    Returns
    -------
    s : int
        The index of the sampled event.
