    Returns `data` standardized to an integer alphabet.

    The data points should be sortable if the alphabet size is greater than
    four. This is because we use the `bisect` module to standardize the data
    whenever the alphabet size is five or larger.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : iterable
        The data to be standardized.  The items in data must be hashable and
        also sortable. If, for example, the data consists of frozensets, then
        the alphabet can not (and will not) be sorted properly. The result
        will be that the data is incorrectly standardized.
    alphabet : list
        The ordered symbols in the alphabet. These symbols are standardized to
        integers from 0 to len(`alphabet`)-1. Caution: If the alphabet is not
        sorted, then the data will not be standardized correctly.
    out : NumPy array
        The output NumPy array whose length is at least as large as the
        length of `data`.
    validate : bool
        If `True`, then make sure that the data only contains symbols in the
        specified alphabet. If `alphabet` is None, this parameter is ignored.


    Returns
    -------
    out : NumPy array
        An integer NumPy array containing the standardized data.
    alphabet : list
        The ordered symbols in the alphabet. These symbols are standardized to
        integers from 0 to len(`alphabet`)-1.

    Notes
    -----
    Generally, only one pass through `data` is required, but if `alphabet` is
    `None`, then two passes are necessary.  The time-complexity, assuming
    an alphabet was provided is O( len(data) * log(len(alphabet)) ). When
    `validate` is `True`, then two passes are required.

    Returns conditional counts from `data`.

    ALERT: `data` must not be a generator.

    To obtain counts for joint distribution only, use fLength=0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : NumPy array
        The data used to calculate morphs. Note: `data` cannot be a generator.
        Also, if standardize is True, then data can be any indexable iterable,
        such as a list or tuple.
    hLength : int
        The maxmimum history word length used to calculate morphs.
    fLength : int
        The length of future words that defines the morph.
    marginals : bool
        If True, then the morphs for all histories words from L=0 to L=hLength
        are calculated.  If False, only histories of length L=hLength are
        calculated.
    alphabet : list
        The alphabet to use when creating the morphs. If `None`, then one is
        obtained from `data`. If not `None`, then the provided alphabet
        supplements what appears in the data.  So the data is always scanned
        through in order to get the proper alphabet.
    standardize : bool
        The algorithm requires that the symbols in data be standardized to
        a canonical alphabet consisting of integers from 0 to k-1, where k
        is the alphabet size.  If `data` is already standard, then an extra
        pass through the data can be avoided by setting `standardize` to
        `False`, but note: if `standardize` is False, then data MUST be a
        NumPy array.


    Returns
    -------
    histories : list
        A list of observed histories, corresponding to the rows in `cCounts`.
    cCounts : NumPy array
        A NumPy array representing conditional counts. The rows correspond to
        the observed histories, so this is sparse. The number of rows in this
        array cannot be known in advance, but the number of columns will be
        equal to the alphabet size raised to the `fLength` power.
    hCounts : NumPy array
        A 1D array representing the count of each history word.
    alphabet : tuple
        The ordered tuple representing the alphabet of the data. If `None`,
        the one is created from the data.


    Notes
    -----
    This requires three complete passes through the data. One to obtain
    the full alphabet. Another to standardize the data.  A final pass to
    obtain the counts.

    This is implemented densely.  So during the course of the algorithm,
    we work with a large array containing a row for each possible history.
    Only the rows corresponding to observed histories are returned.
