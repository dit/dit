def perturb_support(pmf, eps=.1, shape='ball', prng=None):
    """
    Returns a new distribution with all nonzero probabilities perturbed.

    Probabilities which are zero in the pmf cannot be perturbed by this method.
    All other probabilities are perturbed via the following process:

    0. Initial pmf ``p`` lives on the ``n``-simplex.
    1. Transform ``p`` via ilr (isometric logarithmic ratio) transform.
    2. Uniformly draw ``n`` random numbers between ``[0,1]``.
    3. Construct new transformed pmf: `p2_ilr = p1_ilr + eps * rand`
    4. Apply inverse ilr transformation.

    Practically, a large value of `eps` means that there is a better chance
    the perturbation will take the distribution closer to the simplex boundary.
    Large distributions (with more than 60 elements) fail, due to some
    underflow issue with the ilr transformation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pmf : NumPy array, shape (n,) or (k,n)
        The distribution to be perturbed. Assumes `pmf` represents linearly
        distributed probabilities. One may pass in `k` such distributions.
    eps : float
        The scaling factor used for perturbing. Values of `10` correspond
        to large perturbations for the ``1``-simplex.
    shape : str
        The type of neighborhood to draw from. Valid options are 'square' or
        'ball'. For 'square', a point is chosen uniformly from a unit square
        centered around `pmf` in ilr coordinates. For 'ball' a point is chosen
        uniformly from the unit circle centered around the pmf in ilr
        coordinates. In both cases, the region is then scaled by `eps`.
    prng : NumPy RandomState
        A random number generator. If `None`, then `dit.math.prng` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    out : NumPy array

def replace_zeros(pmf, delta, rand=True, prng=None):
    """
    Replaces zeros in a pmf with values smaller than `eps`.

    Note that when considering the Aitchison geometry, the boundaries of the
    simplex are infinitely far away from the uniform distribution. So this
    operation, while numerically small, moves to a new distribution that
    is significantly closer to the uniform distribution (relatively speaking).

    The replacement strategy is done in a multiplicative fashion according
    to the following formula [1]_, but optionally, with randomly determined
    replacement values:

        x_i^\prime =
            \begin{cases}
                \delta_i & x_i = 0 \\
                x_i (1 - \sum_i \delta_i) & x_i \neq 0
            \end{cases}

    where :math:`\delta_i` is the replacement value for each zero element.
    This approach is preferred since it preserves the ratios of nonzero
    elements, an important feature of distributions. Simply adding some values
    to the zero elements and then renormalizing would not preserve the ratios.

    Parameters
    ----------
    pmf : NumPy array, shape (n,) or (k, n)
        The distribution or `k` distributions living on the `(n-1)`-simplex.
    delta : float
        A small value for all the zero elements in the pmf.
    rand : bool
        When `True`, the replacement values for zero elements are random
        numbers less than `delta`. When `False`, the replacement values are
        equal to `delta`.
    prng : NumPy RandomState
        A random number generator used to select replacement values when
        `rand` is `True`. If None, then `dit.math.prng` is used.

    Returns
    -------
    d : NumPy array, shape (n,) or (k, n)
        The distributions with zeros replaced.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> d = np.array([.25, .75, 0])
    >>> replace_zeros(d, .01, rand=False)
    array([ 0.2475,  0.7425,  0.01  ])

    Notes
    -----
    When the distribution is determined by counts and the total number of
    counts is known, this method can be modified so that the value of `delta`
    is chosen according to a Bayesian inferential procedure. Not implemented.
