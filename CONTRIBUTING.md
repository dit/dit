If you'd like a feature added to ``dit`` or notice any problems, please file an issue, or, even better, open a pull request. We'll work with you to ensure that the code is tested and documented.

It's appropriate to file an issue when you encounter a problem with `dit`. Be sure to include

* the `dit` version you're using
* the operating system and Python version
* full tracebacks

If you'd like to get in contact about anything, you can reach us through our `slack channel <https://dit-python.slack.com/>`_.
