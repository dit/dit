"""
The I_downarrow unique measure, proposed by Griffith et al, and shown to be inconsistent.

The idea is to measure unique information as the intrinsic mutual information between
and source and the target, given the other sources. It turns out that these unique values
are inconsistent, in that they produce differing redundancy values.
