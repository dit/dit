    Create a mixture distribution: $\sum p_i d_i$

    Parameters
    ----------
    dists: [Distribution]
        List of distributions to mix.  Each distribution is assumed to have
        the same base and sample space.

    weights: [float]
        List of weights to use while mixing `dists`.  The weights are assumed
        to be probability represented in the base of the distributions.

    merge: bool
        If `True` then distributions will be mixed even if they do not share
        the same sample space. The idea is that each of the input distributions
        is reinterpreted on a common, merged sample space. If `False`, then
        an exception will be raised if incompatible distributions are mixed.

    Returns
    -------
    mix: Distribution
        The mixture distribution.

    Raises
    ------
    DitException
        Raised if there `dists` and `weights` have unequal lengths.
    InvalidNormalization
        Raised if the weights do not sum to unity.
    InvalidProbability
        Raised if the weights are not valid probabilities.

        Raised if the sample spaces for each distribution are not compatible.

    Create a mixture distribution: $\sum p_i d_i$

    This version assumes that the pmf for each distribution is of the same
    form, and as a result, will be faster than `mixture_distribution`.
    Explicitly, it assumes that the sample space is ordered exactly the same
    for each distribution and that the outcomes currently represented in the
    pmf are the same as well. Using it in any other case will result in
    incorrect output or an exception.
