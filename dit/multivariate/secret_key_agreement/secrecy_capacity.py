"""
The secrecy capacity is the rate at which X and Y can agree upon a secret key
while Z eavesdrops, and X controlls the channel p(YZ|X).

Given a fixed joint p(XYZ), the secrecy capacity is a lower bound on the one-way
secret key agreement rate since arbitrary input to the channel p(YZ|X) can be
emulated through proper communication on the part of X.

    The rate at which X and Y can agree upon a key over the channel p(YZ|X)

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : Distribution
        The distribution of interest.
    X : iterable
        The indices to consider as the X variable, Alice.
    Y : iterable
        The indices to consider as the Y variable, Bob.
    Z : iterable
        The indices to consider as the Z variable, Eve.
    rv_mode : str, None
        Specifies how to interpret `rvs` and `crvs`. Valid options are:
        {'indices', 'names'}. If equal to 'indices', then the elements of
        `crvs` and `rvs` are interpreted as random variable indices. If
        equal to 'names', the the elements are interpreted as random
        variable names. If `None`, then the value of `dist._rv_mode` is
        consulted, which defaults to 'indices'.
    niter : int, None
        The number of hops to perform during optimization.
    bound_u : int, None
        The bound to use on the size of the variable U. If none, use the theoretical bound of |X|.

    Returns
    -------
    sc : float
        The secrecy capacity.
