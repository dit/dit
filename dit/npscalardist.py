"""
Module defining NumPy array-based distribution classes.

Sparse means the length of outcomes and pmf need not equal the length of the
sample space. There are two important points to keep in mind.
    1) A sparse distribution is not necessarily trim. Recall, a distribution
         is trim if its pmf does not contain null-outcomes.
    2) The length of a sparse distribution's pmf can equal the length of the
       sample space.
If a distribution is dense, then we forcibly make sure the length of the pmf
is always equal to the length of the sample space.

When a distribution is sparse, del d[e] will make the pmf smaller. But d[e] = 0
will simply set the element to zero.

When a distribution is dense, del d[e] will only set the element to zero---the
length of the pmf will still equal the length of the sample space. Also, using
d[e] = 0 still sets the element to zero.

For scalar distributions, the sample space is the alphabet and the alphabet
is a single set. For (joint) distributions, the sample space is provided
at initialization and the alphabet is a tuple of alphabets for each random
variable. The alphabet for each random variable is a set.

    prng : RandomState
        A pseudo-random number generator with a `rand` method which can
        generate random numbers. For now, this is assumed to be something

    Implementation Notes
    --------------------
    The outcomes and pmf of the distribution are stored as a tuple and a NumPy
    array.  The sequences can be either sparse or dense.  By sparse, we do not
    mean that the representation is a NumPy sparse array.  Rather, we mean that
    the sequences need not contain every outcome in the sample space. The order
    of the outcomes and probabilities will always match the order of the sample
    space, even though their length might not equal the length of the sample
    space.

        Initialize the distribution.

        Parameters
        ----------
        outcomes : sequence, dict
            The outcomes of the distribution. If `outcomes` is a dictionary,
            then the keys are used as `outcomes`, and the values of
            the dictionary are used as `pmf` instead.  Note: an outcome is
            any hashable object (except `None`) which is equality comparable.
            If `sort` is `True`, then outcomes must also be orderable.

        pmf : sequence
            The outcome probabilities or log probabilities.  If `None`, then
            `outcomes` is treated as the probability mass function and the
            outcomes are consecutive integers beginning from zero.

        sample_space : sequence
            A sequence representing the sample space, and corresponding to the
            complete set of possible outcomes. The order of the sample space
            is important. If `None`, then the outcomes are used to determine
            the sample space instead.

        base : float, None
            If `pmf` specifies log probabilities, then `base` should specify
            the base of the logarithm.  If 'linear', then `pmf` is assumed to
            represent linear probabilities.  If `None`, then the value for
            `base` is taken from ditParams['base'].

        prng : RandomState
            A pseudo-random number generator with a `rand` method which can
            generate random numbers. For now, this is assumed to be something
            with an API compatible to NumPy's RandomState class. This attribute
            is initialized to equal dit.math.prng.

        sort : bool
            If `True`, then the sample space is sorted first. Usually, this is
            desirable, as it normalizes the behavior of distributions which
            have the same sample space (when considered as a set).  Note that
            addition and multiplication of distributions is defined only if the
            sample spaces (as tuples) are equal.

        sparse : bool
            Specifies the form of the pmf.  If `True`, then `outcomes` and `pmf`
            will only contain entries for non-null outcomes and probabilities,
            after initialization.  The order of these entries will always obey
            the order of `sample_space`, even if their number is not equal to
            the size of the sample space.  If `False`, then the pmf will be
            dense and every outcome in the sample space will be represented.

        trim : bool
            Specifies if null-outcomes should be removed from the sample space
            before it is finalized.  In general, the sample space cannot be
            changed once the distribution has been created.

        validate : bool
            If `True`, then validate the distribution.  If `False`, then assume
            the distribution is valid, and perform no checks.

        Raises
        ------
        InvalidDistribution
