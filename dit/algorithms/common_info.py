    Returns the Gacs-Korner common information K[X1:X2...] over the random
    variables in `rvs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : Distribution
        The distribution from which the common information is calculated. 
    rvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variables for which the Gacs-Korner common
        information is to be computed. If None, then the common information is
        calculated over all random variables.
    crvs : list, None
        The indexes of the random variables to condition the common information
        by. If none, than there is no conditioning.
    rv_names : bool
        If `True`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random variable
        names. If `False`, then the elements of `rvs` are treated as random
        variable indexes.  If `None`, then the value `True` is used if the
        distribution has specified names for its random variables.

    Returns
    -------
    K : float
        The Gacs-Korner common information of the distribution.
