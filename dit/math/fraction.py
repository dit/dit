"""
Function for calculating the simplest faction from a float.

An alternative approach is to use:

    >>> from fractions import Fraction
    >>> x = .12345
    >>> y = Fraction(x)
    >>> y.limit_denominator(10)
    Fraction(1, 8)
    >>> y.limit_denominator(100)
    Fraction(10, 81)

But usually, we are interested in a fraction that matches within some tolerance
and the max denominator that gives a particular tolerance is not obvious.
